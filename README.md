# GoLang - Tax in Norway
GoLang backend for calculating Norwegian tax.

This is a project for me to learn better the go language.

Hopefully this project will evolve over time to create a good data structure and sample 
on how to write a go module.

## Recommended setup

* clone this repo
* install goland from intellij
* Make sure you configured the module settings
* cd into repo
